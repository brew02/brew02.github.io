                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Extended page tables (EPT) are a part of Intel's virtual machine extension (VMX)
                        support for address translation. One of the unique things about EPT is that it
                        allows programmers to easily allow execute-only accesses to pages of memory,
                        something that isn't supported in the regular page tables, and isn't supported
                        for AMD's very similar implementation called nested page tables (NPT). This unique
                        feature has been utilized in

                        for stealthy inline-hooks, allowing for easy monitoring and debugging of interesting
                        pieces of code.

                    <p>
                        Due to the usefulness of such a feature, many individuals have attempted to use
                        other processor features to emulate the execute-only memory capabilities that EPT
                        offers. Unfortunately, most of these processor features are just as, if not more,
                        exclusive than EPT, making them inviable for a cross-platform solution. 
                        But what if there were a processor feature supported across both Intel and AMD processors
                        that would allow for us to emulate this behavior? What if there were a feature that 
                        could be used both with, and without, hardware virtualization to create these 
                        pseudo-EPT hooks? This is exactly what this post aims to answer.

                    <h2>More Security Means More Possibilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over 10 years ago Intel began rolling out new security features for processors
                        that aimed to define stricter isolation between kernel-mode and user-mode memory.
                        The two features primarily responsible for this are supervisor-mode execution
                        prevention (SMEP) and supervisor-mode access prevention (SMAP). As the names of 
                        the features suggest, their purpose is to prevent supervisor-mode (kernel) code
                        from executing and accessing user-mode memory, respectively. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Availability of these features can be checked by executing the <code>CPUID</code>
                        instruction with <code>EAX=07h</code> and <code>ECX=0h</code> and then checking <code>EBX[bit 7]</code>
                        for SMEP support and <code>EBX[bit 20]</code> for SMAP support (Note: SMAP support
                        also implies support for the <code>CLAC</code> and <code>STAC</code> instructions).
                        If a processor supports these features, they can be toggled using <code>CR4[bit 20]</code>
                        for SMEP and <code>CR4[bit 21]</code> for SMAP. Additionally, if SMAP is enabled in
                        the CR4 register, the access control (AC) flag in the RFLAGS register (<code>RFLAGS[bit 18]</code>)
                        can be used to temporarily allow supervisor data accesses to user memory when set. This 
                        bit can be set at current privilege level (CPL) 0 using the <code>STAC</code> instruction and cleared
                        using the <code>CLAC</code> instruction. Strangely, it is possible to update this flag at CPL &gt; 0 by
                        using the <code>POPF</code> instruction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this information in mind, a 
                        <a class="article-link" href="https://github.com/brew02/BudgetEPT" target="_blank">simple proof-of-concept (POC)</a> 
                        can be created that demonstrates how one 
                        could leverage these security features to create pseudo-EPT hooks. The basic idea is 
                        as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Setup page fault (<code>#PF</code>) and debug fault (<code>#DB</code>) handlers 
                            in the interrupt descriptor table (IDT).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Modify <strong>all levels</strong> of the page tables such that the user/supervisor bit
                            (bit 2) is set for the page where the hook is located.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Disable SMEP in the CR4 register.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Enable SMAP in the CR4 register.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ensure that the AC bit is unset in the RFLAGS register.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If done correctly, all code running at CPL &lt; 3 will now generate a <code>#PF</code> when attempting
                        to read or write to our hooked pages, including code executing on the pages. If an access violation is
                        generated, we can handle it much like we would with an EPT violation. 
                        We swap the modified page frame number (PFN) to the original
                        PFN in the page table entry (PTE), set the AC bit in the RFLAGS register, and then
                        set the trap flag (TF) bit in the RFLAGS register (<code>RFLAGS[bit 8]</code>). After letting the instruction 
                        execute, we handle the ensuing <code>#DB</code> by swapping the PFN, resetting the AC bit,
                        and resetting the TF bit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you've been following along closely, you may have already noticed some of the 
                        caveats that this method has. This section will introduce several of these caveats
                        and propose possible solutions for fixing them.

                        <h3>The CR4 Register</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first noticeable caveat with this solution is that the CR4 register, which is 
                            instrumental to this implementation, is able to be read and written to by any 
                            code executing at CPL 0. This poses difficulties as operating systems may wish
                            to have these bits set one way, while we need the bits in the CR4 register 
                            to be set another way for our hooks to remain unseen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here are two solutions to solve this:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                If hardware virtualization technology is leveraged, one could 
                                enable control register exiting within their virtual machine control 
                                structure/block (VMCS/VMCB) to intercept reads and writes to the CR4
                                register. With this enabled, the values that we wish for the CR4
                                register to contain can not only be retained, but the real values
                                can be spoofed, causing the guest to be none-the-wiser to what is 
                                happening. Note: For processors that support it, it would be wise 
                                to utilize a CR4 mask and shadow to reduce the number of exits that 
                                occur, improving performance greatly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If hardware virtualization technology is not leveraged, one could
                                utilize old-fashioned software virtualization techniques to intercept
                                control register accesses. The basic idea behind this form of software virtualization
                                is to force all CPL 0 code to use either CPL 1 or 2 to deprivilege the code enough to cause
                                invalid opcode (<code>#UD</code>) or general protection (<code>#GP</code>) exceptions when executing 
                                privileged instructions (this will require <code>#UD</code> and <code>#GP</code> handlers in the IDT).
                                I might write a brief blog post about this software virtualization in the future as 
                                it's what is used as part of the demonstration in the POC. 
                                In the meantime, I would recommend checking out the 
                                recently released <a class="article-link" href="https://github.com/can1357/selene" target="_blank">selene</a>
                                and old <a class="article-link" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>
                                source code to better understand how it can be used.
                            </li>
                        </ol>  
                        <p>
                            Regardless of how it's achieved, it's important to intercept the CR4 register 
                            so that reads and writes can be spoofed and emulated properly.

                        <h3 id="AC-Bit">The AC Bit</h3>
                        <p>
                            The AC bit is another part of this project that is crucial for its
                            functionality, but it can be read or written to with even less
                            scrutiny than the CR4 register. As mentioned briefly before, despite 
                            the privilege checks for the <code>STAC</code> and <code>CLAC</code> 
                            instructions, it was decided that user-mode code could simply execute a 
                            <code>POPF</code> instruction to update the AC bit. Consequently, it is 
                            possible for code running at any CPL to enable the AC bit, allowing free 
                            reign to read or write to our hooked pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, the solution to this problem is not the easiest. Hardware 
                            virtualization technology doesn't help at all in this case as there is 
                            no way to exit on modifications to the RFLAGS register, and software
                            virtualization would only intercept the <code>STAC</code> and 
                            <code>CLAC</code> instructions due to the strange behavior of the 
                            <code>POPF</code> instruction.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            This leaves us with only one solution: binary instrumentation. This 
                            may seem daunting at first, but when combined with the information in 
                            the <a class="article-link" href="#Race-Condition">race condition</a>
                            section, it should work quite well. The basic idea is to <strong>always</strong>
                            generate a <code>#PF</code> when external code begins to execute our hooked pages, 
                            forcefully reset the AC bit, and disassemble and intercept all instructions 
                            (<code>STAC</code>, <code>CLAC</code>, and <code>POPF</code>)
                            that could modify the AC bit by patching them with an <code>INT 3</code> 
                            (breakpoint (<code>#BP</code>)) instruction (this will require a <code>#BP</code> handler in the IDT).
                            In the <code>#BP</code> handler, we can do some basic checks to see if the code is trying
                            to modify the AC bit and respond accordingly (it would be prudent to not simply 
                            discard modifications, but instead handle them properly).

                        <h3 id="Race-Condition">The Race Condition</h3>
                        <p>
                            The problem with modifying the page tables — such as swapping between the 
                            modified and original PFNs in our case — is that they are generally shared 
                            across all central processing unit (CPU) cores within an operating system (OS).
                            This behavior makes it possible for a separate thread running on a separate 
                            core to accidentally, or purposefully, execute the original page of memory during 
                            a window of time where the original page has been swapped in, 
                            bypassing our hook and potentially revealing it inadvertently. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The key problem here is that the page tables are typically shared between cores. 
                            Thus, one solution would be to enable SMEP and disable SMAP whenever code is 
                            executing outside one of our hooked pages. Once an SMEP access violation is 
                            triggered, we disable SMEP and enable SMAP, and then we swap to a completely
                            new set of page tables where all levels that map our hooked page in the page 
                            tables have new physical mappings controlled solely by us, with the final PTE 
                            mapping the modified PFN for our hooked page, as demonstrated in 
                            <a class="article-link" href="#Modified-Page-Tables">figure 1</a>. This makes it impossible for a 
                            separate thread to snoop our modified memory, but it does introduce a new 
                            issue: page table desynchronization.

                        <p>
                            Page table desynchronization can occur due to changes from the underlying OS,
                            such as freeing or paging memory. If any entry within the mappings 
                            that we control is changed to a different physical address in the original 
                            page tables, our modified page tables won't see that update. All 
                            subsequent memory accesses that rely on such an entry (while using our 
                            modified page table), have the potential of translating to incorrect 
                            physical addresses, as shown in 
                            <a class="article-link" href="#Page-Table-Desync">figure 2</a>. This 
                            could not only inadvertently reveal our hooks, it 
                            could also be catastrophic for the system.

                            Fortunately, there are actually quite a few ways to solve this issue. One 
                            of the easiest methods would be to employ something similar to our page 
                            swapping mechanism that we use to handle SMAP access violations. Within our 
                            modified page table, we can make it such that all mappings, besides our hooks 
                            and some other critical structures and code such as the IDT, IDT handlers, GDT, 
                            etc..., are null. This will make it so that any access to <em>uncertain</em> 
                            memory will generate a <code>#PF</code>, which can then be handled by swapping the CR3 
                            value to the original page tables, setting the TF, executing the original 
                            instruction, and then swapping back to the modified page tables in the 
                            <code>#DB</code> handler. Although this solution may be one of the easier ones, it still 
                            comes with heavy performance implications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Possibly the best solution, however, would be to maintain complete page table 
                            synchronization in the first place. A possible method of achieving this is 
                            described in the 
                            <a class="article-link" href="#Page-Tables">page tables</a> section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            P.S. The reason why we enable SMEP, and consequently cause SMEP related access 
                            violations, is primarily due to issues described in the
                            <a class="article-link" href="#AC-Bit">AC bit</a> section.

                        <p>
                            Another issue that comes as a result of this method is that our hooks, by default,
                            are completely bypassed by code running at CPL 3, ironically enough. Possibly the 
                            easiest way to fix this issue is to set the execute-disable (XD) bit (bit 63) in 
                            the PTE that maps the hooked page. Then, you can employ a method similar to what 
                            was discussed in the 
                            <a class="article-link" href="#Race-Condition">race condition</a> section to handle 
                            the access violations.

                        <p>
                            The final caveat that must be taken care of is that we must modify the 
                            user/supervisor bit (or the XD bit as detailed in the 
                            <a class="article-link" href="#CPL">CPL</a> section) in the page tables 
                            to achieve these hooks. Code running at CPL &lt; 3 has the innate ability to 
                            access the page tables, allowing for easy examination of our modifications. One of the most 
                            commonly used methods for accessing arbitrary entries in the page 
                            tables is to use a self-referencing page-map level 4 entry (PML4E), as 
                            shown in 
                            <a class="article-link" href="#Self-Referencing-PML4E">figure 3</a>.
                            Without going into too much detail, this entry in the PML4 will 
                            contain the same PFN used to map the current page table in the 
                            CR3 register. This allows for virtual addresses to be constructed
                            that allow for easy, arbitrary access to any entry.

                        <p>
                            Why is this important information? Because this method of accessing 
                            page table entries is exactly what we are going to leverage to prevent 
                            access to the page tables. The simple solution is to mark this PML4E 
                            as not present, and handle all of the resulting access violations 
                            accordingly. If an attempt is made to read from an entry that has been 
                            modified, you now have the ability to spoof that information. Writes to
                            the page tables should not simply be ignored or put into a dummy 
                            page table somewhere, they should be examined carefully and emulated 
                            accordingly.                   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next logical question would be: what if there are other mappings 
                            for entries in the page tables? A practical example of this would be 
                            the use of <code>MmMapIoSpace</code> (Windows &lt;1803) to map the physical address 
                            of some page table structure (PML4, PDPT, PD, PT). This would provide 
                            a user with a separate virtual address that allowed access to that mapped 
                            page table structure, completely bypassing the use of the self-referencing 
                            PML4E. The solution to this problem can be broken into two distinct 
                            scenarios:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Additional mappings have already been made before we gain control 
                                of the page tables.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Additional mappings are attempting to be made with control of the page 
                                tables.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            If additional mappings have already been made before we gained control 
                            of the page tables (i.e. before gaining control of the self-referencing 
                            PML4E), then we must simply traverse all page table mappings and find 
                            and modify all mappings that map entries in the page tables so that they
                            are inaccessible. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If we already have control of the page tables, our job is, at least on 
                            paper, much simpler. All that needs to be done is ensure that all of 
                            these new mappings are made inaccessible as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With full control of the page tables, it is now possible to hide the 
                            presence of any tampering and prevent modifications that would remove
                            the hooks. It is also possible to maintain synchornization across 
                            separate page tables, which is quite useful for solving the page table 
                            desynchronization problem in the 
                            <a class="article-link" href="#Race-Condition">race condition</a> section.

                    <p>
                        Although I was able to 
                        <a class="article-link" href="https://github.com/brew02/BudgetEPT" target="_blank">demonstrate</a> 
                        the possiblity of using this concept 
                        without the aid of any hardware virtualization, it is in my opinion that 
                        the work necessary to achieve total system transparency without the use 
                        of hardware virtualization would typically far exceed the effort needed.
                        That said, there are still some situations where this concept remains quite 
                        viable and useful for creating pseudo-EPT hooks, particularly when coupled 
                        with some level of hardware virtualization 
                        technology on either Intel or AMD processors.
